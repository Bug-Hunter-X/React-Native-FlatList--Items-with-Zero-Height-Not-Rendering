This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that have a height of zero. This often happens when the item's style or layout calculations result in a height of 0, causing the FlatList to miscalculate the layout and not render the items correctly.  The error message might not be explicit, but you'll see blank space where the items should be.
