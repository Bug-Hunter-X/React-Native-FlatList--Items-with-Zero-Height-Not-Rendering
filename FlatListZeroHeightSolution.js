The solution is to ensure that every item in your FlatList has a non-zero height. This can often be achieved by carefully examining your item's styling and layout. Here are some approaches:

1. **Explicit Height:** Set a fixed height using `height` style property. While this can work, it's often less flexible.
2. **Minimum Height:** Set a minimum height using `minHeight` style property.  This is more flexible than a fixed height.
3. **Content-Based Height:** Use a component that measures the content height dynamically, such as `Text` or `View` with content that inherently defines its size.
4. **Debugging Layout:** Use the React Native Debugger or other tools to visually inspect the layout and identify the cause of the zero-height issue.

Example showing minimum height being used to fix the bug:

```javascript
// FlatListZeroHeightSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View style={{ minHeight: 40, padding: 10, borderBottomWidth: 1, borderBottomColor: '#ccc' }}>
      <Text>{item.text}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
