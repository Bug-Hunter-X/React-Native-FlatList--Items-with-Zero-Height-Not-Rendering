This repository demonstrates a common but tricky bug in React Native's FlatList component. The issue arises when list items have a calculated height of zero, preventing them from rendering correctly.  The solution involves carefully examining the item's styling and layout to ensure a non-zero height is always calculated.  The example uses a simple list of items, some with intentionally incorrect styles to trigger the bug. This shows how subtle styling issues can lead to unexpected layout problems.
